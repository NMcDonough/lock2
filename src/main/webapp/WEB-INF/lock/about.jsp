    I began this webpage and the games presented with a vague idea of a wonderful video game and no idea how to make it. Armed with only a basic knowledge of how to make a full stack application and a tutorial from <a target="_blank" href="http://phaser.io">Phaser.io</a>, I started this journey with <a [routerLink]="['/phaser-game']">Phaser Game</a>, based on the tutorial, and progressed from there.

    What you see now is the culmination of my work on my website. It's bad, it's getting better, and I'm proud of it.
